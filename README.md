Goodreads is the worldâ€™s largest site for readers and book recommendations.Their mission is to help people find and share books they love.

In this project I created a Good Reads website rating dasboard to better understand readers preferences.
I analysed and presented graphically useres top 10 rating scores for books titles, authors and publishers.The Top rated books where Harry Potter book series, J.K Rawling for the author category and for publishers Scholastic Inc.
Next, I showed the 5 top languages of rated books which showed 94.71% of them whern in English.
I also presented the top 10 publishers by precentage of books published by each one which showed at the top 'Vintage' with almost 20% published books from the total website.

For further analysis and broadening the understanding of readers prefernces I'd concentrate on two main feilds. First, I would recommend the website to ask voters to enter their age for better understnading of users choices of books.For example, it will be interesting to learn the distrubution of ages of Harry Potter voters. Second, analysing the top rated books by genere can help better understand users prefences of books.
